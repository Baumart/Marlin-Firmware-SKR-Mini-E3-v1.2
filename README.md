# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). We've posted detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduces a layer of abstraction so that all the existing high-level code can be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility. Retaining AVR compatibility and a single code-base is important to us, because we want to make sure that features and patches get as much testing and attention as possible, and that all platforms always benefit from the latest improvements.

## Current Target

Creality Ender-3 with SKR Mini E3 v1.3 and Creality BLTouch 3.1

## Features Enabled

- BLTouch (Bi-Linear Bed Leveling)
- Custom Status Screen (Ender-3 Default)
- Disable Boot Screens
- Disable Info Screen
- Enabled Slim Menus
- Disabled Chamber Thermal Protection (I do not use a cage for my Ender-3, it runs free!)
- Enabled S Curve Acceleration
- Enabled Linear Advance 
- Bed Size is 225x225mm
- Enable Menu to Level Bed Corners (and Center)
- Pre-Heat for "Fillament Cold Pull" instead of Pre-heat for ABS

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
